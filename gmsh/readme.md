# Notes from testing of GMSH
* Meshing of 3d geometry can be done only with unstructured meshes.
* If you want to mesh an imported 3d geometry use the geo module and import the stp file using merge.
* The Python API to the occ module does not work entirely.
* Structured meshes can be constructed manually.
